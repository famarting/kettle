# Kettle

This project is inspired by the Kubernetes api-server in particular by [CustomResourceDefinition] functionality. Kubernetes api-server offers a completely generic and extensible REST api with CRUD operations for an extensible set of resources.

## Status

This is just an experiment to see if isolating the concept of an api-server makes sense, and also just to play with some frameworks and technologies (currently mainly Quarkus)

## Things to do

There are still lots of things to do, improve the codebase of api-server or implement a CLI utility similar to kubectl, ...
